- Works on data analytic of circuit.pk and make a framework on Rshiny for sales platform. As a Data Science Intern at Xekera Systems, I spend most of my time analyzing advertisement data from digital marketing (social media & search engines etc.) coupled with sales data to extract meaningful information and provide appropriate advice to the companies to sell their products better.
- I build AI models to forecast future sales, analyze return reasons, suggest necessary steps to gain & retain more customers and tell how to compete in an increasingly competitive market. Based on historical data analyses I propose what customer satisfaction means in terms of sales and what time of year is the best to market a product.

- I investigate how social channels are helping to boost sales and how effective a particular advertising campaign or an email template has been. I spend most of my time figuring out effects of different advertisements streams on the earned revenue, how revenue is being split into different product categories, which customers are buying which types of products, how emails and advertisements about a particular product relate to the sales, customer retention, returns analysis and others. To communicate all these insights clearly and efficiently, I build business intelligence reports, dashboards, and interactive visualizations. Because of my techy responsibilities . 

- All of these things require diversified toolset at my disposal which include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, A/B testing, Recommender Systems, Time Series Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Data Visualizations, Programming, Scripting, Automation Testing, Database Management, Cloud Platform tools and others.
